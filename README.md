# multi-lingual-stance-dataset

The objective of stance detection is to ascertain a text's (or author’s) attitude toward a certain topic or statement. It is a key component of many NLP tasks such as rumour confirmation, fact-checking, and fake news detection.  
Due to the lack of annotated data in other languages, the majority of stance detection research has focused on English.

I looked for a multilingual dataset for stance detection as part of my dissertation. This project demonstrates the statistical analysis I carried out on four datasets that I discovered to be helpful in moving forward with my thesis.
For additional reference, the details of these datasets, including the URL of the GitHub repository and the published paper, are provided below.

#Purpose
When I was working on Multilingual Stance Detection task I didn't find any open source data-sets to work on, I believe there are people just like me who are working on these tasks and I hope it helps them.
